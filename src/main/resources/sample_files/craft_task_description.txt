    Sr. SWE Craft Task

Couple of years back, Google create a brain simulator in their labs, that learned
how to recognize cats in YouTube videos (http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/26/google-brain-recognises-cats)

Your task is a stripped down version of the same idea.
Imagine you have a single video frame (image_with_cats.txt) with some cat images.
In addition, you have a perfect cat image (perfect_cat_image.txt). Your goal is
to find the cats in the video frame. You can return the position of the cat in the
image matrix, and the percentage match. You can optionally provide a threshold
match value (like 85% confidence this is the image you are looking for).

You should expose the functionality above as a JSON REST service
that takes the video frame on the input (as a text matrix), and the threshold
match value, and returns the output again as a REST response. You don't have to
pass the image you are looking for (the cat image) in the REST interface - it remains constant.

The above should be implemented in Java with Java frameworks if needed.

Note: The video frame could be "noisy" - you may not find the perfect cat image,
therefore, you have to deal with certain possibilities what you have found is the
correct answer.
